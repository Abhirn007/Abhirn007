👋 Hi, I’m @Abhirn007, a budding developer eager to explore the vast world of coding!

👀 I’m interested in unraveling the mysteries of web development/web3 development and diving into the realms of programming languages.

🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a strong foundation for my coding journey.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects or join study groups to enhance my skills and learn from fellow developers.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on [@abhishekrnmishra].

⚡ Fun fact: The term "bug" in computer science originated in 1947 when Grace Hopper found an actual moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. She famously taped the insect into the logbook, coining the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches. Now, whenever we encounter software issues, we owe a nod to the world's first literal computer bug! 🐞
